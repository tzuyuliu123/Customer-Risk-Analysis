# Customer Risk Analysis 
This dashboard uses the dataset from Pwc Switzerland Power Bi Job Simulation on Forage (Task 3) [Link](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg). 
The purpose of this project is to support retention manager to identify the reason and potential solutional strategy for high customer churn rate. 
# Descriptio
This project use EDA to find the key characteristic of churned customer and observe the area of services that TeleCompany can enhance to maintain customer to create more profit. 

Here is a short workflow that I did in this case:
1. Data cleaning: import excel file into Power BI and ensure the data is consistent and ready to analyse.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize a prototype of churn customer. Here are some key features of churned customers.
   - Subscribed the Internet and phone services, with the majority of them were using fiber optic internet.
   - Pay the phone bill monthly and using electronic check.
   - End the service with Tele Company within 1 year.
3. Bulid a Customer Churn Analysis dashboard to allow Telecompany to contiune monitor the changing in churn customer pool.
4. Noted some recommendations plan in the first page.

# Key insights and reflection
1. Number of Tech ticket is one of the big indicators, shoeing that Telecompany have some issue in fiber optic internet.
   An icrease in number of tech support tickets indicates that customers frequently encounter technical issues retaled Internet, which negatively impacts their experience with TeleCompany, leading to a high churn rate.
2. Short and frequnt paymant is one of characteristic of customer churning. With short period of paying phone bill, customer have more chance to consider changing Tele Serive Company with smaller opporunity cost to end service with TeleCompany. This shows that TeleCompamy is easy to replace by other Tele service firm.
3. Recommanded plans:
   a. Technical improvment in fiber optic Internet.
   b. Set a longer Tele service plan, such as half-year plan or Yearly plan.
   c. Promote automatic payment method.
